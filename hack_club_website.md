        <p>Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are small, arboreal mammals that are native to the mountain ranges of the Himalayas and southwestern China. Despite their name, they are not closely related to giant pandas, though they share a similar diet of bamboo. They are known for their beautiful reddish-brown fur, bushy tails, and charming personalities.</p>

        <h2>Habitat and Behavior</h2>
        <p>Red pandas primarily live in temperate forests, where they use their sharp claws and excellent climbing skills to navigate the trees. They are mostly solitary animals and are most active during dawn and dusk. Red pandas are also known for their playful behavior, which makes them a favorite among wildlife enthusiasts.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>Red pandas are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their population is threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change. Efforts are being made to protect their natural habitats and to raise awareness about their conservation needs.</p>
